## Getting Started

This project is a [_fastlane_](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) plugin. To get started with `fastlane-plugin-schindler`, add it to your project by running:

```shell

```

## RubyGems

[fastlane-plugin-schindler](https://rubygems.org/gems/fastlane-plugin-schindler)

```shell

### 2. Edit Fastfile
After Init succeeds, the fastlane folder will be generated in the current directory. 

Edit ./fastlane/Fastfileï¼Œfor example: 
```ruby
# A sample Fastfile
lane :delete do

    auto_confirm: "auto",               # Optional, 'auto'-skip, default no. Skip the second confirmation, or wait for user confirmation before deleting after scanning

## Run tests for this plugin

To run both the tests, and code style validation, run

```
rake
```

To automatically fix many of the styling issues, use
```
rubocop -a
```

## Extras(important by 08/10/2023)
Due to changes in App Store Connect API 2.4, beta_tester_metrics for betaTesters in Spaceship are invalid, resulting in Tester status information no longer being available.

Based on the betaTesters interface (appstoreconnect.apple.com/iris/v1/betaTesters), I updated this repository. And submitted the commit to fastlane.

Consider that it takes time and days for the commit to go through, so while waiting for it to go through, if you get an error running this script, scroll down.

### Find local fastlane
First, we need to find the betaTesters file in the local fastlane

```shell
# Get local gem folder path
which fastlane
# Assuming that the previous step yields '/Users/hongtao/.mtl-cli-env/gems/bin/fastlane'

# Further find the specific fastlane version, note that here you need to open the gem folder by deleting the path to fastlane (replace '/bin/fastlane' at the end with '/gems') and then append the path to gems (/gems).
open /Users/hongtao/.mtl-cli-env/gems/gems

# After opening finder, find the latest local version of fastlane, for example, the author's local is fastlane-2.214.0, drag this folder to the terminal window and append '/spaceship/lib/spaceship/connect_api/models/beta_tester.rb' to the end. , and then open this file
open /Users/hongtao/.mtl-cli-env/gems/gems/fastlane-2.214.0/spaceship/lib/spaceship/connect_api/models/beta_tester.rb
```

### Modify local fastlane
Second, we need to manually modify the betaTesters property in the local fastlane

before modification
```ruby
require_relative '../model'
module Spaceship
  class ConnectAPI
    class BetaTester
      include Spaceship::ConnectAPI::Model

      attr_accessor :first_name
      attr_accessor :last_name
      attr_accessor :email
      attr_accessor :invite_type
      attr_accessor :invitation

      attr_accessor :apps
      attr_accessor :beta_groups
      attr_accessor :beta_tester_metrics
      attr_accessor :builds

      attr_mapping({
        "firstName" => "first_name",
        "lastName" => "last_name",
        "email" => "email",
        "inviteType" => "invite_type",
        "invitation" => "invitation",

        "apps" => "apps",
        "betaGroups" => "beta_groups",
        "betaTesterMetrics" => "beta_tester_metrics",
        "builds" => "builds"
      })

      ......
```

after modification
```ruby
require_relative '../model'
module Spaceship
  class ConnectAPI
    class BetaTester
      include Spaceship::ConnectAPI::Model

      attr_accessor :first_name
      attr_accessor :last_name
      attr_accessor :email
      attr_accessor :invite_type
      attr_accessor :invitation

      attr_accessor :apps
      attr_accessor :beta_groups
      attr_accessor :beta_tester_metrics
      attr_accessor :builds

      # add by xjkstar 2023-08-09
      attr_accessor :isDeleted
      attr_accessor :beta_tester_state
      attr_accessor :last_modified_date
      attr_accessor :installedCfBundleShortVersionString
      attr_accessor :installedCfBundleVersion
      attr_accessor :removeAfterDate
      attr_accessor :latestExpiringCfBundleShortVersionString
      attr_accessor :latestExpiringCfBundleVersionString
      attr_accessor :installedDevice
      attr_accessor :installedOsVersion
      attr_accessor :installedDevicePlatform
      attr_accessor :installedAppPlatform

      attr_mapping({
        "firstName" => "first_name",
        "lastName" => "last_name",
        "email" => "email",
        "inviteType" => "invite_type",
        "invitation" => "invitation",

        "apps" => "apps",
        "betaGroups" => "beta_groups",
        "betaTesterMetrics" => "beta_tester_metrics",
        "builds" => "builds",

        # add by xjkstar 2023-08-09
        "isDeleted" => "isDeleted",
        "betaTesterState" => "beta_tester_state",
        "lastModifiedDate" => "last_modified_date",
        "installedCfBundleShortVersionString" => "installedCfBundleShortVersionString",
        "installedCfBundleVersion" => "installedCfBundleVersion",
        "removeAfterDate" => "removeAfterDate",
        "latestExpiringCfBundleShortVersionString" => "latestExpiringCfBundleShortVersionString",
        "latestExpiringCfBundleVersionString" => "latestExpiringCfBundleVersionString",
        "installedDevice" => "installedDevice",
        "installedOsVersion" => "installedOsVersion",
        "installedDevicePlatform" => "installedDevicePlatform",
        "installedAppPlatform" => "installedAppPlatform"
      })

      ......
```
